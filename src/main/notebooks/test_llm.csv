MED37198641,"Retraction note: Clinical Epigenetics 2012, 4:9 http://www.clinicalepigeneticsjournal.com/content/4/1/9The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article. After publication, concerns were raised regarding similarities among different parts of the methylation PCR gel image in Fig.1B. Specifically, the two lanes representing the second Tumor (T) sample and the positive control (CTL+) appear highly similar. In addition, the unmethylated (U) lane of the CTL+ group appears to be repeated multiple times in the negative control (H2O) group.The authors have provided some of the raw data used to produce this image, which confirmed that the image was a composite, and have been unable to sufficiently justify the similarity between the T and CTL+ groups.The Editor-in-Chief therefore no longer has confidence in the presented data. Christine Nyiraneza, Christine Sempoux, Alex Kartheuser and Karin Dahan do not agree to this retraction. The Publisher has not been able to obtain a current email address for Roger Detry.","invalid results, research misconduct and data manipulation","invalid results, research misconduct and data manipulation","invalid results, research misconduct and data manipulation","invalid results, research misconduct and data manipulation"
MED37200266,"Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results in multiple figures. Specifically,The -actin panels in Figs 3D and 4A appear similar despite representing different conditions.The -actin panels in Figs 3E and 4B appear similar.The -actin panels in Figs 3F and 4C appear similar.These issues were discussed with the corresponding author and the last author. The corresponding author stated that some of the data underlying the results in this article are no longer available, and they provided files described as the uncropped images underlying some of the panels in the above figures.The corresponding author acknowledged that the -actin panel in Fig 4A is incorrect. They provided two different images described as the original blot underlying the correct -actin panel for Fig 4A, as well as the images described as the underlying blots for -actin panel in Fig 3D and PA700 panel in Fig 4A. There were discrepancies between the published panels and underlying blots, and the concerns were not fully resolved.The corresponding author stated that the -actin panels are identical in Figs 3E and 4B, and Figs 3F and 4C, respectively. They stated that these figures present the same samples, and they apologise that these intentional duplications of the loading controls were not declared in the figure legends. Images described as the underlying blots for PA700 and -actin in Fig 4C did not appear to match the published panels.The corresponding author stated that experiments related to Fig 3 and Fig 4 were conducted between the years 20062009. They indicated that experiments were performed in batches but did not provide specific information about when each of the presented experiments were performed. Files provided for PA700 and IP: 3-NT/IB:PA700 in Fig 4B suggest that the western blots were performed at different times. The Editors remain concerned regarding the discrepancy in dates and the lack of clarity about whether experimental results presented together were collected at the same time.In light of the concerns about the reliability of these data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.JX and MHZ did not agree with the retraction. SA responded but expressed neither agreement nor disagreement with the retraction. SW, MZ, and QW either did not respond directly or could not be reached.

MED37200305,"After this article was published, similarities were noted between this article and submissions by other research groups which call into question the validity and provenance of the reported results. In addition, during editorial follow-up, a number of data extraction and analysis errors were found and confirmed by the first author, meaning it is not clear the conclusions are supported.In light of these issues, PLOS ONE cannot stand by the reliability of the reported research, and the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article [1].HW agreed with the retraction.

MED37200303,"Following the publication of this article [1], concerns were raised regarding results presented in Figures 1, 2, 5, and 6. Specifically,When adjusting the color levels to visualize the background, there appear to be irregularities in the background around the bands presented in the Figure 1A EMSA blots.When adjusting the color levels to visualize the background, there appear to be irregularities in the background of the Figure 5A results, suggesting that these results may have been obtained from spliced blots.When adjusting the color levels to visualize the background, there appear to be irregularities in the background around the bands presented in the Figure 5B results.The Figure 6A Con-siRNA panel appears similar to the Figure 6A Collectrin stable panel when rotated 180. In addition, these two panels partially overlap with the Figure 6A mIMCD3 results.When rotated 180, the Figure 6D mIMCD3 results appear more similar than expected to the Figure 6D Collectrin stable results.The corresponding author provided underlying data for the Figure 1A EMSA blots. Although the bands on these blots did not appear to be a perfect match with the published figure, they did appear to support the published results. The underlying data for Figures 5A and 5B are no longer available.Regarding Figure 6, the corresponding author explained that the wrong panels were used during the preparation of Figures 6A and 6D, and provided replacement data. However, the corresponding authors explanation does not clarify the concerns pertaining to the Figure 6D panels.In addition to the concerns listed above, during the assessment of the underlying data provided for the Figure 2A blots, it appeared that the published Snapin results in lanes 2, 3, and 4 matched the underlying data in lanes 4, 3, and 2 respectively when the underlying data was flipped horizontally, suggesting that the Figure 2A Snapin results may have been mislabelled. Furthermore, the corresponding author indicated that the incorrect Collectrin panel was used during the preparation of this figure and provided replacement data.The underlying data for Figures 1, 2, 5C, and 6 were provided for editorial review. Furthermore, the corresponding author stated that the underlying data for Figures 3, 4, 7, and 8 remain available upon request, but that the underlying data for Figures 5A and 5B are no longer available.In light of the concerns affecting multiple figure panels that question the integrity of these data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.JW, AY, II, JE, KY, SA, YSK, and HM agreed with the retraction, and apologized for the issues with the published article.

They provided files described as the original images raw images underlying some of the panels in the above figures, however not all appeared to match the published panels.The first author stated that the PA700/S10B panels in Figs 2B and 3A are accidental duplicates of the OGT panel in Fig 3A, and they provided a replacement panel. They also stated that the 7 panel in Fig 2B is incorrect and provided a replacement. The replacement panel provided for 7 appears to partially overlap with the 7 panel in Fig 6C despite representing different conditions.The first author stated that the PA700/S10B panels in Figs 2E and 3B are identical and represent the same conditions. They acknowledge that the reuse of the image should have been declared in the figure legends.The first author provided versions of the western blots in Fig 6 showing more of the gels horizontally. These versions of the images raised additional concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the data in Fig 6.In light of the concerns affecting multiple figure panels that question the reliability of these data, the PLOS ONE Editors retract this article.MHZ agreed with the retraction.

After publication, concerns were raised regarding the data presented in the figures. Specifically: In Fig.3e, the right image appears highly similar to Fig.3e left in [1].In Fig.3c, plot 1 appears highly similar to plot 2, and plot 3 appears highly similar to plot 6.LV-control in Fig.5d appears highly similar to shRNA control in Fig. S2b. Additionally, the authors used SMMC-7721, QGY-7703 and L02 cell lines, which have been reported to be contaminated with HeLa cells.The authors have stated that the data duplication was caused by simple errors, and the overlap with [1] occurred due to shared resources. However, they have been unable to provide sufficient raw data from the original experiments to fully address these concerns.Due to the high number of image concerns and the use of unsuitable cell models for hepatocellular carcinoma, the Editor-in-Chief no longer has confidence in the presented data.Hongda Ding agrees to this retraction.
