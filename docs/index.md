The data queried from ePMC will be programatically updated to [retracted.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmillanacosta/retractable/main/data/retracted.json).

The data with retracted reason added is under [retractable.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmillanacosta/retractable/main/data/retractable.json). It can be visualized [here](/retractable/data)

Some stats available under [basic_stats](/retractable/00_basic_stats)
