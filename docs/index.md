# Retractable

This projects queries journal article databases for retracted papers and collects them in a machine readable way. It aims to serve as an open-source alternative to the [Retraction Watch](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj767jFpbGAAxWEG-wKHR1TB3AQFnoECB0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fretractionwatch.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3oJSvWLxnlsBGenPZTl2rG&opi=89978449), though the reports are by no means as comprehensive as theirs.
